# vec-2D

vec-2D is a simple 2D vector implementation that provides common vector operations and operator overloading for more seamless usage.

## Features

- Simple 2D vector implementation with x and y components
- Operator overloading for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between vectors and scalars
- Common vector operations such as dot product, cross product, norm, normalize, rotate, and more

## Usage

To use vec-2D, simply include the vec2.hpp header in your project. This is the only necessary header to include.

vec-2D is built using premake5 as a static library. To use it, you must create a premake5 workspace that includes the vec-2D library. You can then build the workspace with premake5 to create an executable.

It is advisable to include vec-2D in a user-made repository as a git submodule. This allows you to keep the vec-2D code separate from your own code, making it easier to manage dependencies and track changes.
